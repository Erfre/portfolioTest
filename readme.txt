	Portfolio site

This is my first try at making a portfolio page for myself. Where the main page
is one giant canvas where balls bounce around and makes random connections to 
each other.

	Installation

1.Download this repository
2.Navigate to HTML>index.html
3.Open index.html in your preferred browser
4.Sit back and enjoy watching the colorful balls flying around.

	History/Goal

This was a project I was thinking of using as my own personal portfolio page. 
Although I've yet used it. 
My main goals were to learn more about website creation and how web pages worked.
But I still wanted to have some fun with the canvas element since I really enjoyed
writing javascript.

I still like the simplicity of the design so I might use it one day, or something
similar. With a lot cleaner code.
