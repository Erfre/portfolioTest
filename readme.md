# Portfolio website

This is my first try at making a website. It was going to be my portfolio page, but I never put it up.

## Installation

1.Download this repository
2.Navigate to HTML>index.html
3.Open index.html in your preferred browser
4.Sit back and enjoy watching the colorful balls flying around.

### History/Goal

This project was supposed to be my own personal portfolio page.
My main goals were to learn more about website creation and how web pages worked.
But I still wanted to have some fun with the canvas element since I really enjoyed javascript and the canvas.

I still like the simplicity of the design so I might use it one day, or something
similar. With a lot cleaner code.
